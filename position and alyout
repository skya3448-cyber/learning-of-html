STATIC:it does keep the element in normal,this is the defaut for all elements 
RELATIVE:you can move it using top,right,bottom,left.The originnal space is still preserved.
ASOLUTE:REmoved from normal document flow,positioned relaative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
FIXED:Positioned relative to the viewport,stays in place even when scrolling
STICKY:Hybrid of relative and fixed,acts like relative until a scroll threshold is met.



position: static is the default positioning for all elements. It follows the normal document flow,
meaning elements appear in order from top to bottom as written in HTML. It is mainly used when no 
special positioning is needed, and properties like top, left, right, and bottom do not affect it.
position: relative keeps the element in the normal document flow but allows it to be moved 
slightly from its original position using top, left, right, or bottom. It is commonly used when 
you need small adjustments in layout or when you want to set a reference point for absolutely 
positioned child elements.
position: absolute removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative
to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element that is not static). It is mainly used for dropdown
menus, tooltips, popups, and placing elements exactly where needed.
position: fixed also removes the element from the normal flow but positions it relative to
the browser window. It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled. It is commonly used 
for fixed navigation bars, floating buttons, and chat icons.
position: sticky is a combination of relative and fixed positioning. The element behaves 
like relative until a certain scroll point is reached, then it becomes fixed. It is mostly used 
for sticky headers, navigation bars, and section titles that need to remain visible while scrolling.
