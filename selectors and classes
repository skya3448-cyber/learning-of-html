core:
tag selectors:target all elements of a specific type
classes:used to target specific elements without affecting others.In html,you add class="class name";in CSS ,you use a dot prefix:class name
       -classes are reusable and can be applied to multiple different elements to save time.
       -you can chain classes to target elements that have multiple specific classes
IDs:Targeted with a hash symbol. Unlike classes.IDs must be unique to a single element on a page.
